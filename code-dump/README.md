**Hey there!**<br>
I get it; *why follow the tutorial when all the code is here, ready for copy pasting?* Well, you see, that's where you're wrong! <br><br>
⚠️ **This code is not ready for copy-pasting!** ⚠️,<br><br>
This code should be structurally built - Just simply running this will **error**, and nobody likes an error.<br><br>
You should use this code dump to check everything is going well with the tutorial!
